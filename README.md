# Godot Array Sorting Algorithm
 This is an attempt to use classic sorting algorithm to sort arrays in godot 4.
 
 I started learning sorting algorithm in collage, so I decide to put my knowledge to good use.

 I am not a good programmer currently, and feel free to pull request to help make this project better.

 ## What is in the project
 Currently there are 6 sorting algorithm, all of them have ascending sort and descending sort, you cancheck the DES on the HUD to switch.
